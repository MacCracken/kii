## v0.5.0 — M4 quantization

Host: x86_64 Linux, single-core wall-clock via `clock_gettime`. Cyrius `6.0.1`.

| Bench | Iterations | Per-op | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `quantize_nearest_rgb @ 1024×1024` | 1,048,576 | **274 ns** | Linear scan over 16 palette entries × 3 channels (48 multiplies + 48 adds + 16 compares per pixel). Cold-cache, single-thread, no SIMD. |

**Extrapolation**: a 1024×1024 image takes ~287 ms to fully quantize sequentially. RAMGON.png (1,065,600 pixels) takes ~292 ms.

**Headroom** (not yet exploited):
- Per-pixel inner loop has no early-exit; even a "we already found distance 0" short-circuit would help on saturated colors.
- Palette-side optimization: precompute palette in an SoA layout, vectorize the distance² across all 16 entries via SIMD.
- Caller-side optimization: skip alpha-fully-transparent pixels (quantize → 0 fallback).

None of these are v1.0-scope; capture here so future cycles know what's available.
